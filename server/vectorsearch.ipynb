      "Question: what is polymorphism?\n",
      "User's answer: In the realm of object-oriented programming, polymorphism serves as a powerful mechanism allowing different classes to be perceived and utilized through a unified interface provided by a superclass. This not only enhances the adaptability and flexibility of the code but also fosters a modular approach, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability. By embracing polymorphism, developers can design systems that seamlessly accommodate new functionalities and variations without the need for extensive modifications, thus promoting robustness and efficiency in software development.\n",
